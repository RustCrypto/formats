Pure Rust implementation of Base32 ([RFC 4648]).

Implements lower and upper case Base32 variants without data-dependent branches
or lookup  tables, thereby providing portable "best effort" constant-time
operation.

Supports `no_std` environments and avoids heap allocations in the core API
(but also provides optional `alloc` support for convenience).
