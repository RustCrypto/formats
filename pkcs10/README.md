Pure Rust implementation of Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #10:
Certification Request Syntax Specification ([RFC 2986]).

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About PKCS#10

PKCS#10 is a format for certification requests (sometimes called certificate
signing requests). This format usually contains a public key.

You can identify a PKCS#10 request encoded as PEM (i.e. text) by the
following:

```text
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
```

PKCS#10 certification requests can also be serialized in an ASN.1-based binary
format. The PEM text encoding is a Base64 representation of this format.

## Supported Algorithms

This crate is implemented in an algorithm-agnostic manner with the goal of
enabling PKCS#10 support for any algorithm.

That said, it has been tested for interoperability against keys generated by
OpenSSL for the  following algorithms:

- RSA (`id-rsaEncryption`)

Please open an issue if you encounter trouble using it with a particular
algorithm, including the ones listed above or other algorithms.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

This crate requires **Rust 1.56** at a minimum.

We may change the MSRV in the future, but it will be accompanied by a minor
version bump.
