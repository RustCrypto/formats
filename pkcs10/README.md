Pure Rust implementation of Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #10:
Private-Key Information Syntax Specification ([RFC 2986]).

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About PKCS#10

A certification request consists of a distinguished name, a public key,
and optionally a set of attributes, collectively signed by the entity
requesting certification. Certification requests are sent to a
certification authority, which transforms the request into an X.509
public-key certificate. (In what form the certification
authority returns the newly signed certificate is outside the scope
of this document. A PKCS #7 [2] message is one possibility.)

You can identify a PKCS#10 certification request encoded as PEM (i.e. text) by the
following:

```text
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
```

## Supported Algorithms

This crate is implemented in an algorithm-agnostic manner with the goal of
enabling PKCS#8 support for any algorithm.

That said, it has been tested for interoperability against keys generated by
OpenSSL for the following algorithms:

- ECC (`id-ecPublicKey`)
- Ed25519 (`id-Ed25519`)
- RSA (`id-rsaEncryption`)
- X25519 (`id-X25519`)

Please open an issue if you encounter trouble using it with a particular
algorithm, including the ones listed above or other algorithms.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

This crate requires **Rust 1.65** at a minimum.

We may change the MSRV in the future, but it will be accompanied by a minor
version bump.
