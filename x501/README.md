Pure Rust implementation of X.501 Types.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About X.501

X.501 is a series of standards originally specified in [ISO/IEC 9594] and
subsequently used in numerous standards such as [RFC 2986] and [RFC 5280].
The most common modern use of these types is in X.509 certificates and related
standards.

### Conformity Note

Many of the types in this crate are defined in both [ISO/IEC 9594] and IETF
standards such as [RFC 2986] and [RFC 5280]. Where types differ between these
standards, this crate conforms to the IETF standards.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

This crate requires **Rust 1.56** at a minimum.

We may change the MSRV in the future, but it will be accompanied by a minor
version bump.
