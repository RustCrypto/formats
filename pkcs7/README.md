## ðŸš¨ DEPRECATED! ðŸš¨

The `pkcs7` crate is deprecated and will not receive further releases.

Please migrate to the following instead:

- For Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS): use the [`cms` crate](https://github.com/RustCrypto/formats/tree/master/cms).
- For PKCS#7 block padding: use [`block_padding::Pkcs7`](https://docs.rs/block-padding/latest/block_padding/struct.Pkcs7.html)

See [#1045] for more information.
