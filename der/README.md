Pure Rust embedded-friendly implementation of the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
for Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) as described in ITU X.690.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

This crate provides a `no_std`-friendly implementation of a subset of ASN.1 DER
necessary for decoding/encoding the following cryptography-related formats
implemented as crates maintained by the [RustCrypto] project:

- [`cms`]: Cryptographic Message Syntax
- [`pkcs1`]: RSA Cryptography Specifications
- [`pkcs5`]: Password-Based Cryptography Specification
- [`pkcs8`]: Private-Key Information Syntax Specification
- [`pkcs12`]: Personal Information Exchange Syntax
- [`sec1`]: Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- [`spki`]: X.509 Subject Public Key Info
- [`x509-cert`]: Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
- [`x509-ocsp`]: Online Certificate Status Protocol

The core implementation avoids any heap usage (with convenience methods
that allocate gated under the off-by-default `alloc` feature).

The DER decoder in this crate performs checks to ensure that the input document
is in canonical form, and will return errors if non-canonical productions are
encountered. There is currently no way to disable these checks.

### Features

- Rich support for ASN.1 types used by PKCS/PKIX documents
- Performs DER canonicalization checks at decoding time
- `no_std` friendly: supports "heapless" usage
- Optionally supports `alloc` and `std` if desired
- No hard dependencies! Self-contained implementation with optional
  integrations with the following crates, all of which are `no_std` friendly:
  - `const-oid`: const-friendly OID implementation
  - `pem-rfc7468`: PKCS/PKIX-flavored PEM library with constant-time decoder/encoders
  - `time` crate: date/time library
