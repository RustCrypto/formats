          Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Brainpool Standard
                      Curves and Curve Generation

Abstract

   This memo proposes several elliptic curve domain parameters over
   finite prime fields for use in cryptographic applications.  The
   domain parameters are consistent with the relevant international
   standards, and can be used in X.509 certificates and certificate
   revocation lists (CRLs), for Internet Key Exchange (IKE), Transport
   Layer Security (TLS), XML signatures, and all applications or
   protocols based on the cryptographic message syntax (CMS).

1.  Introduction

   Although several standards for elliptic curves and domain parameters
   exist (e.g., [ANSI1], [FIPS], or [SEC2]), some major issues have
   still not been addressed:

   o  Not all parameters have been generated in a verifiably pseudo-
      random way.  In particular, the seeds from which the curve
      parameters were derived have been chosen ad hoc, leaving out an
      essential part of the security proof.

   o  The primes selected for the base fields have a very special form
      facilitating efficient implementation.  This does not only
      contradict the approach of pseudo-random parameters, but also
      increases the risk of implementations violating one of the
      numerous patents for fast modular arithmetic with special primes.

   o  No proofs are provided that the proposed parameters do not belong
      to those classes of parameters that are susceptible to
      cryptanalytic attacks with sub-exponential complexity.

   o  Recent research results seem to indicate a potential for new
      attacks on elliptic curve cryptosystems.  At least for
      applications with the highest security demands or under
      circumstances that complicate a change of parameters in response
      to new attacks, the inclusion of a corresponding security
      requirement for domain parameters (the class group condition, see
      Section 2) is justified.

   o  Some of the proposed subgroups have a non-trivial cofactor, which
      demands additional checks by cryptographic applications to prevent
      small subgroup attacks (see [ANSI1] or [SEC1]).

   o  The domain parameters specified do not cover all bit lengths that
      correspond to the commonly used key lengths for symmetric
      cryptographic algorithms.  In particular, there is no 512-bit
      curve defined, but only one with a 521-bit length, which may be
      disadvantageous for some implementations.

   Furthermore, many of the parameters specified by the existing
   standards are identical (see [SEC2] for a comparison).  Thus, there
   is still a need for additional elliptic curve domain parameters that
   overcome the above limitations.

1.1.  Scope and Relation to Other Specifications

   This RFC specifies elliptic curve domain parameters over prime fields
   GF(p) with p having a length of 160, 192, 224, 256, 320, 384, and 512
   bits.  These parameters were generated in a pseudo-random, yet
   completely systematic and reproducible, way and have been verified to
   resist current cryptanalytic approaches.  The parameters are
   compliant with ANSI X9.62 [ANSI1] and ANSI X9.63 [ANSI2], ISO/IEC
   14888 [ISO1] and ISO/IEC 15946 [ISO2], ETSI TS 102 176-1 [ETSI], as
   well as with FIPS-186-2 [FIPS], and the Efficient Cryptography Group
   (SECG) specifications ([SEC1] and [SEC2]).

   Furthermore, this document identifies the security and implementation
   requirements for the parameters, and describes the methods used for
   the pseudo-random generation of the parameters.

   Finally, this RFC defines ASN.1 object identifiers for all elliptic
   curve domain parameter sets specified herein, e.g., for use in X.509
   certificates.

   This document does neither address the cryptographic algorithms to be
   used with the specified parameters nor their application in other
   standards.  However, it is consistent with the following RFCs that
   specify the usage of elliptic curve cryptography in protocols and
   applications:

   o  [RFC5753] for the cryptographic message syntax (CMS)

   o  [RFC3279] and [RFC5480] for X.509 certificates and CRLs

   o  [RFC4050] for XML signatures

   o  [RFC4492] for TLS

   o  [RFC4754] for IKE

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Requirements on the Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters

   Throughout this memo, let p > 3 be a prime and GF(p) a finite field
   (sometimes also referred to as Galois Field or GF(p)) with p
   elements.  For given A and B with non-zero 4*A^3 + 27*B^2 mod p, the
   set of solutions (x,y) for the equation E: y^2 = x^3 + A*x + B mod p

   over GF(p) together with a neutral element O and well-defined laws
   for addition and inversion define a group E(GF(p)) -- the group of
   GF(p) rational points on E.  Typically, for cryptographic
   applications, an element G of prime order q is chosen in E(GF(p)).

   A comprehensive introduction to elliptic curve cryptography can be
   found in [CFDA] and [BSS].

   Note 1: We choose {0,...,p-1} as a set of representatives for the
   elements of GF(p).  This choice induces a natural ordering on GF(p).

2.1.  Security Requirements

   The following security requirements are either motivated by known
   cryptographic analysis or aim to enhance trust in the recommended
   curves.  As this specification aims at a particularly high level of
   security, a restrictive position is taken here.  Nevertheless, it may
   be sensible to slightly deviate from these requirements for certain
   applications (e.g., in order to achieve higher computational
   performance).  More details on requirements for cryptographically
   strong elliptic curves can be found in [CFDA] and [BSS].

   1.  Immunity to attacks using the Weil or Tate Pairing.  These
       attacks allow the embedding of the cyclic subgroup generated by G
       into the group of units of a degree-l extension GF(p^l) of GF(p),
       where sub-exponential attacks on the discrete logarithm problem
       (DLP) exist.  Here we have l = min{t | q divides p^t - 1}, i.e.,
       l is the order of p mod q.  By Fermat's Little Theorem, l divides
       q-1.  We require (q-1)/l < 100, which means that l is close to
       the maximum possible value.  This requirement is considerably
       stronger than those of [SEC2] and [ANSI2] and also excludes
       supersingular curves, as those are the curves of order p+1.

   2.  The trace is not equal to one.  Trace one curves (or anomalous
       curves) are curves with #E(GF(p)) = p.  Satoh and Araki [SA],
       Semaev [Sem], and Smart [Sma] independently proposed efficient
       solutions to the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem
       (ECDLP) on trace one curves.  Note that these curves are also
       excluded by requirement 5 of Section 2.2.

   3.  Large class number.  The class number of the maximal order of the
       quotient field of the endomorphism ring End(E) of E is larger
       than 10^7.  Generally, E cannot be "lifted" to a curve E' over an
       algebraic number field L with End(E) = End(E') unless the degree
       of L over the rationals is larger than the class number of
       End(E).  Although there are no efficient attacks exploiting a
       small class number, recent work ([JMV] and [HR]) also may be seen
       as argument for the class number condition.

RFC 5639    ECC Brainpool Standard Curves & Curve Generation  March 2010


   4.  Prime group order.  The group order #E(GF(p)) shall be a prime
       number in order to counter small-subgroup attacks (see [HMV]).
       Therefore, all groups proposed in this RFC have cofactor 1.  Note
       that curves with prime order have no point of order 2 and
       therefore no point with y-coordinate 0.

   5.  Verifiably pseudo-random.  The elliptic curve domain parameters
       shall be generated in a pseudo-random manner using seeds that are
       generated in a systematic and comprehensive way.  The methods by
       which the parameters have been obtained are explained in Appendix
       A.

   6.  Proof of security.  For all curves, a proof should be given that
       all security requirements are met.  These proofs are provided in
       [EBP].

   In [BG], attacks are described that apply to elliptic curve domain
   parameters where q-1 has a factor u in the order of q^(1/3).
   However, the circumstances under which these attacks are applicable
   can be avoided in most applications.  Therefore, no corresponding
   security requirement is stated here.  However, it is highly
   recommended that developers verify the security of their
   implementations against this kind of attack.

2.2.  Technical Requirements

   Commercial demands and experience with existing implementations lead
   to the following technical requirements for the elliptic curve domain
   parameters.

   1.  For each of the bit lengths 160, 192, 224, 256, 320, 384, and
       512, one curve shall be proposed.  This requirement follows from
       the need for curves providing different levels of security that
       are appropriate for the underlying symmetric algorithms.  The
       existing standards specify a 521-bit curve instead of a 512-bit
       curve.

   2.  The prime number p shall be congruent 3 mod 4.  This requirement
       allows efficient point compression: one method for the
       transmission of curve points P=(x,y) is to transmit only x and
       the least significant bit LSB(y) of y.  For p = 3 mod 4, we get
       (y^2)^((p+1)/4) = y*y^((p-1)/2), which is either y or -y by
       Fermat's Little Theorem; hence, y can be computed very
       efficiently using the curve equation.  This requirement is not
       always met by the parameters defined in existing standards.

RFC 5639    ECC Brainpool Standard Curves & Curve Generation  March 2010


   3.  The curves shall be GF(p)-isomorphic to a curve E': y^2 = x^3 +
       A'*x + B' mod p with A' = -3 mod p.  This property permits the
       use of the arithmetical advantages of curves with A = -3, as
       shown by Brier and Joyce [BJ].  For p = 3 mod 4, approximately
       half of the isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over GF(p)
       contain a curve E' with A' = -3 mod p.  Precisely, if a curve is
       given by E: y^2 = x^3 + A*x + B mod p with -3 = A*u^4 being
       solvable in GF(p) and u=Z is a solution to this equation, then
       the requirement is fulfilled by means of the quadratic twist E':
       y^2 = x^3 + Z^4*A*x + Z^6*B mod p, and the GF(p)-isomorphism is
       given by F(x,y) := (x*Z^2, y*Z^3).  Due to this isomorphism,
       E(GF(p)) and E'(GF(p)) have the same number of points, share the
       same algebraic structure, and hence offer the same level of
       security.  This constraint has also been used by [SEC2] and
       [FIPS].

   4.  The prime p must not be of any special form; this requirement is
       met by a verifiably pseudo-random generation of the parameters
       (see requirement 5 in Section 2.1).  Although parameters
       specified by existing standards do not meet this requirement, the
       need for such curves over (pseudo-)randomly chosen fields has
       already been foreseen by the Standards for Efficient Cryptography
       Group (SECG), see [SEC2].

   5.  #E(GF(p)) < p.  As a consequence of the Hasse-Weil Theorem, the
       number of points #E(GF(p)) may be greater than the characteristic
       p of the prime field GF(p).  In some cases, even the bit-length
       of #E(GF(p)) can exceed the bit-length of p.  To avoid overruns
       in implementations, we require that #E(GF(p)) < p.  In order to
       thwart attacks on digital signature schemes, some authors propose
       to use q > p, but the attacks described, e.g., in [BRS], appear
       infeasible in a well-designed Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

   6.  B shall be a non-square mod p.  Otherwise, the compressed
       representations of the curve-points (0,0) and (0,X), with X being
       the square root of B with a least significant bit of 0, would be
       identical.  As there are implementations of elliptic curves that
       encode the point at infinity as (0,0), we try to avoid
       ambiguities.  Note that this condition is stable under quadratic
       twists as described in condition 3 above.  Condition 6 makes the
       attack described in [G] impossible.  It can therefore also be
       seen as a security requirement.  This constraint has not been
       specified by existing standards.

3.  Domain Parameter Specification

   In this section, the elliptic curve domain parameters proposed are
   specified in the following way.

      For all curves, an ID is given by which it can be referenced.

      p is the prime specifying the base field.

      A and B are the coefficients of the equation y^2 = x^3 + A*x + B
      mod p defining the elliptic curve.

      G = (x,y) is the base point, i.e., a point in E of prime order,
      with x and y being its x- and y-coordinates, respectively.

      q is the prime order of the group generated by G.

      h is the cofactor of G in E, i.e., #E(GF(p))/q.

      For the twisted curve, we also give the coefficient Z that defines
      the isomorphism F (see requirement 3 in Section 2.2).

   The methods for the generation of the parameters are given in
   Appendix A.  Proofs for the fulfillment of the security requirements
   specified in Section 2.1 are given in [EBP].

4.  Object Identifiers and ASN.1 Syntax

4.1.  Object Identifiers

   The root of the tree for the object identifiers defined in this
   specification is given by:

      ecStdCurvesAndGeneration OBJECT IDENTIFIER::= {iso(1)
      identified-organization(3) teletrust(36) algorithm(3) signature-
      algorithm(3) ecSign(2) 8}

   The object identifier ellipticCurve represents the tree for domain
   parameter sets.  It has the following value:

      ellipticCurve OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {ecStdCurvesAndGeneration 1}

   The tree containing the object identifiers for each set of domain
   parameters defined in this RFC is:

      versionOne OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {ellipticCurve 1}

   The following object identifiers represent the domain parameter sets
   defined in this RFC:

      brainpoolP160r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {versionOne 1}

      brainpoolP160t1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {versionOne 2}

      brainpoolP192r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {versionOne 3}

      brainpoolP192t1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {versionOne 4}

      brainpoolP224r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {versionOne 5}

      brainpoolP224t1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {versionOne 6}

      brainpoolP256r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {versionOne 7}

      brainpoolP512r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {versionOne 13}

      brainpoolP512t1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {versionOne 14}

4.2.  ASN.1 Syntax for Usage with X.509 Certificates

   The domain parameters specified in this RFC SHALL be used with X.509
   certificates in accordance with [RFC5480].  In particular,

   o  the algorithm field of subjectPublicKeyInfo MUST be set to:

      *  id-ecPublicKey, if the algorithms that can be used with the
         subject public key are not restricted, or

      *  id-ecDH to restrict the usage of the subject public key to
         Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement, or

      *  id-ecMQV to restrict the usage of the subject public key to
         Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV) key agreement, and

   o  the field algorithm.parameter of subjectPublicKeyInfo MUST be of
      type:

      *  namedCurve to specify the domain parameters by one of the
         Object Identifiers (OIDs) defined in Section 4.1, or

      *  specifiedCurve to specify the domain parameters explicitly as
         defined in [RFC5480], or

      *  implicitCurve, if the domain parameters are found in an
         issuer's certificate.

   If the domain parameters are explicitly specified using the type
   specifiedCurve in the field algorithm.parameter of
   subjectPublicKeyInfo, ANSI X9.62 [ANSI1] and [RFC5480] allow
   indicating whether or not a curve and base point have been generated
   verifiably in a pseudo-random way.  Although the parameters specified
   in Section 3 have all been generated by the pseudo-random methods
   described in Appendix A, these algorithms deviate from those mandated
   in ANSI X9.62, A.3.3.1.  Consequently, applications following ANSI
   X9.62 or [RFC5480] will not be able to verify the pseudo-randomness
   of the parameters.  In order to avoid rejection of the parameters,
   the ASN.1 encoding SHOULD NOT specify that the curve or base point
   has been generated verifiably at random.  In particular,
   certification authorities (CAs) SHOULD set the contents of
   specifiedCurve in the following way:

   o  version is set to ecpVer1(1).

RFC 5639    ECC Brainpool Standard Curves & Curve Generation  March 2010


   o  fieldId includes the fieldType prime-field and as parameter the
      value p of the selected domain parameters as specified in Section
      3.

   o  curve includes the values a and b of the selected domain
      parameters as specified in Section 3, but seed is absent.

   o  base is the octet string representation of the base point G of the
      selected domain parameters as specified in Section 3.

   o  order is set to q of the selected domain parameters as specified
      in Section 3.

   o  cofactor is set to 1.

   o  hash is absent.

5.  Security Considerations

   The level of security provided by symmetric ciphers and hash
   functions used in conjunction with the elliptic curve domain
   parameters specified in this RFC should roughly match or exceed the
   level provided by the domain parameters.  The following table
   indicates the minimum key sizes for symmetric ciphers and hash
   functions providing at least (roughly) comparable security.

Appendix A.  Pseudo-Random Generation of Parameters

   In this appendix, the methods used for pseudo-random generation of
   the elliptic curve domain parameters are described.  A comprehensive
   description is given in [EBP].

   Throughout this section the following conventions are used:

   The conversion between integers x in the range 0 <= x <= 2^L - 1 and
   bit strings of length L is given by x <--> {x_1,...,x_L} and the
   binary expansion
   x = x_1 * 2^(L-1) + x_2 * 2^(L-2) + ... + x_(L-1)*2 + x_L, i.e., the
   first bit of the bit string corresponds to the most significant bit
   of the corresponding integer and the last bit to the least
   significant bit.

   For a real number x, let floor(x) denote the highest integer less
   than or equal to x.

   For updating the seed s of 160-bit length we use the following
   function update_seed(s):

   1.  Convert s to an integer z.

   2.  Convert (z+1) mod 2^160 to a bit string t and output t.

A.1.  Generation of Prime Numbers

   This section describes the systematic selection of the base fields
   GF(p) proposed in this specification.  The prime generation method is
   similar to the method given in FIPS 186-2 [FIPS], Appendix 6.4, and
   ANSI X9.62 [ANSI1], A.3.2.  It is a modification of the method
   "incremental search" given in Section 8.2.2 of [ISO3].

   For computing an integer x in the range 0 <= x <= 2^L - 1 from a seed
   s of 160-bit length, we use the following algorithm find_integer(s):

   1.  Set v = floor((L-1)/160) and w = L - 160*v.

   2.  Compute h = SHA-1(s).

   3.  Let h_0 be the bit string obtained by taking the w rightmost bits
       of h.

   4.  Convert s to an integer z.

   5.  For i from 1 to v do:

RFC 5639    ECC Brainpool Standard Curves & Curve Generation  March 2010


       A.  Set z_i = (z+i) mod 2^160.

       B.  Convert z_i to a bit string s_i.

       C.  Set h_i = SHA-1(s_i).

   6.  Let h be the string obtained by the concatenation of h_0,...,h_v
       from left to right.

   7.  Convert h to an integer x and output x.

   The following procedure is used to generate an L bit prime p from a
   160-bit seed s.

   1.  Set c = find_integer(s).

   2.  Let p be the smallest prime p >= c with p = 3 mod 4.

   3.  If 2^(L-1) <= p <= 2^L - 1 output p and stop.

   4.  Set s = update_seed(s) and go to Step 1.

   For the generation of the primes p used as base fields GF(p) for the
   curves defined in this specification (and the corresponding twisted
   curves), the following values (in hexadecimal representation) have
   been used as initial seed s:

   These seeds have been obtained as the first 7 substrings of 160-bit
   length each of Q = Pi*2^1120, where Pi is the constant 3.14159...,
   also known as Ludolph's number, i.e.,

      Q = Seed_p_160||Seed_p_192||...||Seed_p_512||Remainder,
      where || denotes concatenation.

   Using these seeds and the above algorithm the following primes are
   obtained:

A.2.  Generation of Pseudo-Random Curves

   The generation procedure is similar to the procedure given in FIPS
   PUB 186-2 [FIPS], Appendix 6.4, and ANSI X9.62 [ANSI1], A.3.2.

   For computing an integer x in the range 0 <= x <= 2^(L-1) - 1 from a
   seed s of 160-bit length, we use the algorithm find_integer_2(s),
   which slightly differs from the method used for the generation of the
   primes.

   1.  Set v = floor((L-1)/160) and w = L - 160*v - 1.

   2.  Compute h = SHA-1(s).

   3.  Let h_0 be the bit string obtained by taking the w rightmost bits
       of h.

   4.  Convert s to an integer z.



Lochter & Merkle              Informational                    [Page 24]

RFC 5639    ECC Brainpool Standard Curves & Curve Generation  March 2010


   5.  For i from 1 to v do:

       A.  Set z_i = (z+i) mod 2^160.

       B.  Convert z_i to a bit string s_i.

       C.  Set h_i = SHA-1(s_i).

   6.  Let h be the string obtained by the concatenation of h_0,...,h_v
       from left to right.

   7.  Convert h to an integer x and output x.

   The following procedure is used to generate the parameters A and B of
   a suitable elliptic curve over GF(p) and a base point G from a prime
   p of bit length L and a 160-bit seed s.

   1.  Set h = find_integer_2(s).

   2.  Convert h to an integer A.

   3.  If -3 = A*Z^4 mod p is not solvable, then set s = update_seed(s)
       and go to Step 1.

   4.  Compute one solution Z of -3 = A*Z^4 mod p.

   5.  Set s = update_seed(s).

   6.  Set B = find_integer_2(s).

   7.  If B is a square mod p, then set s = update_seed(s) and go to
       Step 6.

   8.  If 4*A^3 + 27*B^2 = 0 mod p, then set s = update_seed(s) and go
       to Step 1.

   9.  Check that the elliptic curve E over GF(p) given by y^2 = x^3 +
       A*x + B fulfills all security and functional requirements given
       in Section 3.  If not, then set s = update_seed(s) and go to Step
       1.

   10. Set s = update_seed(s).

   11. Set k = find_integer_2(s).

   12. Determine the points Q and -Q having the smallest x-coordinate in
       E(GF(p)).  Randomly select one of them as point P.

RFC 5639    ECC Brainpool Standard Curves & Curve Generation  March 2010


   13. Compute the base point G = k * P.

   14. Output A, B, and G.

   Note: Of course P could also be used as a base point.  However, the
   small x-coordinate of P could possibly render the curve vulnerable to
   side-channel attacks.

   For the generation of curve parameters A and B, and the base points G
   defined in this specification, the following values (in hexadecimal
   representation) have been used as initial seed s:

      Seed_ab_160 for brainpoolP160r1:
      2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C762E7160

      Seed_ab_192 for brainpoolP192r1:
      F38B4DA56A784D9045190CFEF324E7738926CFBE

      Seed_ab_224 for brainpoolP224r1:
      5F4BF8D8D8C31D763DA06C80ABB1185EB4F7C7B5

      Seed_ab_256 for brainpoolP256r1:
      757F5958490CFD47D7C19BB42158D9554F7B46BC

      Seed_ab_320 for brainpoolP320r1:
      ED55C4D79FD5F24D6613C31C3839A2DDF8A9A276

      Seed_ab_384 for brainpoolP384r1:
      BCFBFA1C877C56284DAB79CD4C2B3293D20E9E5E

      Seed_ab_512 for brainpoolP384r1:
      AF02AC60ACC93ED874422A52ECB238FEEE5AB6AD

   These seeds have been obtained as the first 7 substrings of 160-bit
   length each of R = floor(e*2^1120), where e denotes the constant
   2.71828..., also known as Euler's number, i.e.,

      R = Seed_ab_160||Seed_ab_192||...||Seed_ab_512||Remainder,
      where || denotes concatenation.
