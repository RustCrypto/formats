## About

This crate supports encoding and decoding RSA private and public keys
in either PKCS#1 DER (binary) or PEM (text) formats.

PEM encoded RSA private keys begin with:

```text
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

PEM encoded RSA public keys begin with:

```text
-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
```
