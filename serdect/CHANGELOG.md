## 0.3.0 (2025-01-06)

NOTE: this release includes major breaking changes to the wire format, namely
all bytestrings now include a length prefix, even when serializing fixed-size
arrays. This is intended to work around deficiencies in the `serde` API
(see serde-rs/serde#2120) as well as serde-based format implementations which
have variable-time behavior when using `serialize_tuple`.

Any binary data serialized with previous versions of `serdect` now needs a
length prefix prepended to the data, which will vary depending on the
particular data format.

### Changed
- Switch to length-prefixed encoding using the `serialize_bytes` method ([#1112], [#1515])
- MSRV 1.70 ([#1244])
